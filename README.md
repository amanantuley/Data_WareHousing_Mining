# 🗄️ Data_WareHousing_Mining  

📊 A project exploring the concepts, design, and implementation of **Data Warehousing** and **Data Mining** techniques.  
This repository covers schemas, OLAP operations, and practical applications of mining algorithms for knowledge discovery.  

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
- 🏗️ **Data Warehousing**: Organizing and structuring large datasets for efficient querying and reporting.  
- 🔎 **Data Mining**: Extracting patterns, knowledge, and insights using algorithms and statistical methods.  
- 📈 **OLAP Operations**: Drill-down, roll-up, slicing, dicing for multidimensional analysis.  
- 🤖 **Mining Techniques**: Classification, Clustering, Association Rules, and Prediction.
